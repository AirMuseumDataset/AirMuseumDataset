### The AirMuseum Dataset

The AirMuseum dataset is intended for multi-robot stereo-visual and inertial Simultaneous 
Localization And Mapping (SLAM). It consists in five indoor multi-robot scenarios acquired with 
ground and aerial robots in a former Air Museum at ONERA Meudon, France. Those scenarios were 
designed to exhibit some specific opportunities and challenges associated to collaborative SLAM. 
Each scenario includes synchronized sequences between multiple robots with stereo images and 
inertial measurements. They also exhibit explicit direct interactions between robots through the 
detection of mounted AprilTag markers. Ground-truth trajectories for each robot were computed using 
Structure-from-Motion algorithms and constrained with the detection of fixed AprilTag markers 
placed as beacons on the experimental area. It is available for downloading at the following link :
